# loan-approval

This is a Loan Approval Classification task. Using the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data), I will use machine learning models with the help of Apache Spark, to check their performance.

# Progress:

Till now I did:
- Data exploration and initial analysis: histograms, correlation matrix
- Implementing some changes in dataset: changing categorical data to numeric type, handling outliers, balancing dataset, standarization
- Running Rndom Forest model with hiperparameters tuning  

# Technologies I used:
* jupiter notebook
* python
* python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, imblearn, pyspark)

# Future development

- implementing more models
- implementing Kafka
